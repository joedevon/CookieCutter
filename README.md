# CookieCutter: Fixing GDPR Cookie Consent
ðŸš« Take a Stand Against Intrusive GDPR Cookie Popups

**Enough is Enough**:

What happened to our society? I have yet to meet a single person who likes GDPR cookie consent popups, but not one person has done a thing about it. We are not impotent. We can effect change. The popup I just encountered was the final straw. Today I am stepping up. 

**Introduction**:

Welcome to CookieCutter, streamlining GDPR for strong privacy minus persistent popups. Change is long overdue.



**Street Cred**:

The last time I started [something](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Accessibility_Awareness_Day) it went pretty well. I have seen the power of uniting a community over a common interest. But our success will depend on YOU. Your involvement is crucial for us to succeed.

**Objective**:

Our aim isn't to compromise data protection, which remains vital, but to address and enhance the current implementation that results in disruptive popups.

**This inititiative needs YOU**:

As a U.S. resident addressing a European policy, international collaboration is key. 

Hereâ€™s our action plan:

**Step 1: Legal Insight** 

Calling on European tech and legal experts to pinpoint the exact legislative changes needed.

**Step 2: Political Engagement**

Identifying EU politicians who are authorized to propose this legislative change.

**Step 3: Legislative Support**

Compiling a list of EU legislators who can expedite and vote for our proposal.

**Step 4: Social Amplification**

Share our vision on social media, tagging key politicians from steps 2 and 3 to gain momentum.
